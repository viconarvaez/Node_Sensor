# Node_Sensor
The main goal is deploying a node capable to measure variables such as: Temperature, humidity, and Luminiscense, using  external ADC and I2C protocol to communicate Arduino with sensors. 

Sensors:

Temperature : Thermistor
Humidity:     HIH8120
Luminiscense: BH1750FVI
ADC 16 bits:  ADS1115
